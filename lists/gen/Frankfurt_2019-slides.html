  "And our galaxy itself is one of millions of billions\n",
  "In this amazing and expanding universe.\n",
  "Our universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding,\n",
  "In all of the directions it can whiz;\n",
  "As fast as it can go, at the speed of light, you know,\n",
  "Twelve million miles a minute and that's the fastest speed there is.\n",
  "So remember, when you're feeling very small and insecure,\n",
  "How amazingly unlikely is your birth;\n",
  "And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere out in space,\n",
  "'Cause there's bugger all down here on Earth!\n"
