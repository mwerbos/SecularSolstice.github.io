  "When the days are gettin' shorter, and the nights are growin' long,\n",
  "And the north wind puts a tear into your eye,\n",

  "With the fires of lost eons in his eyes.\n",
  "He has seen the rise and fall of kings and continents and all,\n",
  "Rising silent, bold Orion on the rise.\n",
  "When he ascends, no hesitation; when he moves, no turnin' round,\n",
  "Like a soul been called to glory, earthly born but heavenly bound.\n",
  "Now the bird is on the wing, and it's southward that she flies,\n",
  "Hastened on by bold Orion on the rise. CHORUS\n",
  "Orion had a lover. She's the goddess of the hunt,\n",
  "And of the forest and the golden moon.\n",
  "Artemis they called her, the fair sister of the sun,\n",
  "But their time together ended all too soon.\n",
  "Apollo took his vengeance on the man his sister loved.\n",
  "An arrow sped him to a painful death;\n",
  "But once a month she visits him, a moon among the stars,\n",
  "Looking down with whispered love upon her breath. CHORUS\n",
  "Summer comes on all too slowly, and it passes far too fast,\n",
  "And you wonder, is there nothin' that can last?\n",
  "Here today and gone tomorrow as the green leaves turn to red,\n",
  "As the present quickly turns into the past.\n",
  "Cut the wood and stack it high now. Stoke the fires in your home.\n",
  "Burnin' nightly send the smoke up to the sky.\n",
  "Keep the winter at your door and keep the summer in your heart.\n",
  "Drink a toast to bold Orion on the rise. CHORUS 2X\n"
