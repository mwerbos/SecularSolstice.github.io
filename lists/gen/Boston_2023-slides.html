  "Though the shaft is always caving, and the tubes are always jamming,\n",
  "Yet we'll fight our way to water while the stubborn drill is ramming-\n",
  "While the stubborn drill is ramming deeper down.\n",
  "But there's no artesian water, though we're passed three thousand feet,\n",
  "And the contract price is growing, and the boss is nearly beat.\n",
