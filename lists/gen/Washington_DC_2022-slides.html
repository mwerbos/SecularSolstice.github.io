  "Looking down with whispered love upon her breath. CHORUS\n",
  "Summer comes on all too slowly, and it passes far too fast,\n",
  "And you wonder, is there nothin' that can last?\n",
  "Here today and gone tomorrow as the green leaves turn to red,\n",
  "As the present quickly turns into the past.\n",
  "Cut the wood and stack it high now. Stoke the fires in your home.\n",
  "Burnin' nightly send the smoke up to the sky.\n",
  "Keep the winter at your door and keep the summer in your heart.\n",
  "Drink a toast to bold Orion on the rise. CHORUS 2X\n"
