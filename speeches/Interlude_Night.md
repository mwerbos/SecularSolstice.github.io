# Interlude: Night

Our next song marks the beginning of the Night section. As I mentioned, we’ll be spending some time coming to terms with death and with the risk of human extinction. If that’s not how you feel like spending the next half hour or so, that’s okay! You can step out and go have some tea, chill in the lobby - someone will come get you at the end of the Night section. 

Quick logistical note - because this section will be increasingly somber, please hold your applause until after Brighter Than Today.
