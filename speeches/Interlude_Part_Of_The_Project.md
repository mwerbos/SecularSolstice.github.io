# Interlude: Part Of The Project

We here tonight are also part of the story of humanity building its own flourishing.

Some of you, perhaps, are working on your own civilization-scale projects. (I hope these go well for you and for the world.)

Others are doing the hard work of keeping our civilization humming along. Or perhaps you are building something very specific and very personal.

Or maybe you are working on improving your own life - giving yourself the physical and mental infrastructure that you personally need in order to flourish. Or maybe youâ€™re working on getting to a point where you can do that work.

Whatever your current project, or your next one - I wish you luck, and skill, and discernment, and that when you need to, you level up.
