# Interlude: No One Survives

There are many ways to hear this next song. Its original context was a story about a self-perpetuating cycle of trauma. I hear it mostly as a reflection on mortality writ large. If you’re very pessimistic, you can hear it about impending doom. If you’re very optimistic, you can hear it about the eventual heat death of the universe. It’s up to you.

This song will lead directly into the moment of darkness, where we experience the darkness and the silence together for a couple of minutes. You may choose to use this time to reflect, or to grieve, or to savor your existence, or simply to be. It’s up to you.
