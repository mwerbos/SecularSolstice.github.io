<h1 id="hope-is-the-thing-with-feathers">“Hope” Is the Thing with Feathers</h1>
<h2 id="by-emily-dickinson">by Emily Dickinson</h2>
<p>“Hope” is the thing with feathers - That perches in the soul - And sings the tune without the words - And never stops - at all -</p>
<p>And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard - And sore must be the storm - That could abash the little Bird That kept so many warm -</p>
<p>I’ve heard it in the chillest land - And on the strangest Sea - Yet - never - in Extremity, It asked a crumb - of me.</p>
