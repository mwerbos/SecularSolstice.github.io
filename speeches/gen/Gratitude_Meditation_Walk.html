<h1 id="gratitude-meditation-walk">Gratitude Meditation Walk</h1>
<p>This is a meditative ritual. As we walk in a spiral in silence, we honor the past year. Think about what you are grateful for and what has been successful in the past year. Imagine that you are a tree. Instead of trying to flourish new leaves, focus all your energy on your roots and mature in readiness for the next burst of new energy in Springtime. It’s a time to acknowledging all that has happened so far this year and be thankful.”</p>
