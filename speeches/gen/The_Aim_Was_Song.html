<h2 id="by-robert-frost">By Robert Frost</h2>
<p>Before man came to blow it right<br />
The wind once blew itself untaught,<br />
And did its loudest day and night<br />
In any rough place where it caught.</p>
<p>Man came to tell it what was wrong:<br />
It hadn’t found the place to blow;<br />
It blew too hard—the aim was song.<br />
And listen—how it ought to go!</p>
<p>He took a little in his mouth,<br />
And held it long enough for north<br />
To be converted into south,<br />
And then by measure blew it forth.</p>
<p>By measure. It was word and note,<br />
The wind the wind had meant to be—<br />
A little through the lips and throat.<br />
The aim was song—the wind could see.</p>
