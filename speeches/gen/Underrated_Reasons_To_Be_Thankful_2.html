<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>That the Earth hasn’t recently been hit by a solar flare as powerful as the 1859 Carrington event, which is good because that would set electrical lines around the world on fire, meaning months of power outages and simultaneous failures of food, transport, and medical systems.</li>
<li>That it’s pretty rare for an asteroid as large as Chicxulub to hit the Earth, and if anything it’s unusual that we were hit by one only 66 million years ago.</li>
<li>That resistance to antibiotics appears to come at at least some cost to bacteria, meaning that there’s nonzero hope that if we invent enough antibiotics and cycle them or use some other tricks, we can avoid a future where we return to the grim reality of the past where any small accident could be deadly.</li>
<li>That the distasteful layer of dust and oil and grime that slowly settles on all things - if you keep the air clean, does so somewhat less quickly.</li>
