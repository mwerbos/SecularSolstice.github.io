<p>Before we fully leave the darkness behind for the rest of the program, we have one more reflection on finding equanimity and even triumph in the face of risk and fear.</p>
<p>By the way - the reason we keep returning to this theme today is not that I think it is correct to feel hopeless - I don’t actually think that. It’s because hope is a kind of uncertainty, and I think that there is a great power and clarity in finding a foundation for being okay that is unconditional, rooted only in certainties.</p>
<p>And so, this next song takes the position that, in some important senses, we have already won; there is a fundamental kind of triumph that we have already achieved that cannot ever be taken away from us.</p>
