<h2 id="by-wendy-cope">By Wendy Cope</h2>
<p>At lunchtime I bought a huge orange—<br />
The size of it made us all laugh.<br />
I peeled it and shared it with Robert and Dave—<br />
They got quarters and I had a half.</p>
<p>And that orange, it made me so happy,<br />
As ordinary things often do<br />
Just lately. The shopping. A walk in the park.<br />
This is peace and contentment. It’s new.</p>
<p>The rest of the day was quite easy.<br />
I did all the jobs on my list<br />
And enjoyed them and had some time over.<br />
I love you. I’m glad I exist.</p>
