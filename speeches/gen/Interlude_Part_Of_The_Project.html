<p>We here tonight are also part of the story of humanity building its own flourishing.</p>
<p>Some of you, perhaps, are working on your own civilization-scale projects. (I hope these go well for you and for the world.)</p>
<p>Others are doing the hard work of keeping our civilization humming along. Or perhaps you are building something very specific and very personal.</p>
<p>Or maybe you are working on improving your own life - giving yourself the physical and mental infrastructure that you personally need in order to flourish. Or maybe youâ€™re working on getting to a point where you can do that work.</p>
<p>Whatever your current project, or your next one - I wish you luck, and skill, and discernment, and that when you need to, you level up.</p>
