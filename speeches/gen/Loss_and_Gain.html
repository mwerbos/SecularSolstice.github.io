<h2 id="henry-longfellow">Henry Longfellow</h2>
<pre><code>When I compare    </code></pre>
<p>What I have lost with what I have gained,<br />
What I have missed with what attained,<br />
Little room do I find for pride.</p>
<pre><code>I am aware    </code></pre>
<p>How many days have been idly spent;<br />
How like an arrow the good intent<br />
Has fallen short or been turned aside.</p>
<pre><code>But who shall dare    </code></pre>
<p>To measure loss and gain in this wise?<br />
Defeat may be victory in disguise;<br />
The lowest ebb is the turn of the tide.</p>
