<h2 id="by-skyler-crossman">By Skyler Crossman</h2>
<p>Take a moment.</p>
<p>Think of something you want to do better next year, some mistake you want to make less often.</p>
<p>Donâ€™t look for an epiphany, look for a place where slow, incremental effort would help.</p>
<p>Find something that feels one level up from where you are now.</p>
<p>Think of something that matters. If not to the world, then to you.</p>
<p>Actually think about the question for one minute, by the clock.</p>
<p>[turn out the last light, wait for sixty seconds.]</p>
