<h1 id="i-hear-america-singing">I Hear America Singing</h1>
<h2 id="by-walt-whitman">By Walt Whitman</h2>
<p>I hear America singing, the varied carols I hear,<br />
Those of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong,<br />
The carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam,<br />
The mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off work,<br />
The boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deckhand singing on the steamboat deck,<br />
The shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench, the hatter singing as he stands,<br />
The wood-cutter’s song, the ploughboy’s on his way in the morning, or at noon intermission or at sundown,<br />
The delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at work, or of the girl sewing or washing,<br />
Each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else,<br />
The day what belongs to the day—at night the party of young fellows, robust, friendly,<br />
Singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs.</p>
