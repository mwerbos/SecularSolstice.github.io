# Moment of Resolution
## By Skyler Crossman

Take a moment. 

Think of something you want to do better next year, some mistake you want to make less often. 

Donâ€™t look for an epiphany, look for a place where slow, incremental effort would help.

Find something that feels one level up from where you are now.

Think of something that matters. If not to the world, then to you.

Actually think about the question for one minute, by the clock.

[turn out the last light, wait for sixty seconds.]
