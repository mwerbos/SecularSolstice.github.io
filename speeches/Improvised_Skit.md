# Improvised Skit

A subset of participants are given a prompt (e.g. "Discovery of Agriculture") and some prompts (e.g. "What would have been the immediate problems or conflicts caused by the advent of agriculture? Dispute over property rights? Concerns about natural disasters or droughts? Efforts to protect/encircle cultivated land?").  They then perform a skit on this basis.

Can be serious/scientific, funny/absurdist, anachronistic.
