# Schedule Selection

Instead of writing an exact program in advance, the organizers created lists of options for each section.  Then, at the beginning of the event, the attendees split into groups for each section and each group selected the pieces to perform for that section.

While the theme didn't come across as cohesively as a preplanned production, I (Allison Agnello) would still recommend this format for first time groups unsure of how it will be accepted.

For Miami 2022, [these options](../../lists/gen/Miami_2022_options.html) were provided.  Each section contains a balanced mix of activities, speeches, poetry, music and skits.
