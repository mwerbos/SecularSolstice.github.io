# Interlude: Building The Future

We talked, earlier, about the audacity to want things. Let’s go ahead and lean all the way into that.

As a warning, the song gets very briefly non-G-rated at the very end.

Also, a quick note, because I didn’t get this when I first read these lyrics: the first few lines here are about astronomical waste, which is the idea that there’s all this energy out there that we could be harnessing for our own flourishing, and one day perhaps we’ll figure out how.
