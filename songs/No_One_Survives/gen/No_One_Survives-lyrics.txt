And in the end, no one survives,
No one at all gets out alive;
And in the end, no one prevails -
Everyone falls, everyone fails.

There is no love, there is no trust,
The sky above is made of dust,
So lay on down and close your eyes -
No one survives,
No one survives,
No one survives.

[instrumental]

And in the end there is no land,
No holy place for you to stand;
The towers high, the river low -
Beneath the sky you're on your own,

You take your shot, you take your time,
You cast your lot, reel in your line -
There ain't no catch, there ain't no prize,
No one survives,
No one survives,
No one survives.
