#  Level Up
## By Vienna Tang
## An insistant yet triumphant invitation to grow

Jeff Kaufman noted five issues with the song for solstice purposes:

* Most of the words are pickups.
* The lines don't start on a consistent beat.
* Sections have small differences each time they're repeated.
* It's not square. (i.e. section lengths are not powers of two)
* The sung portion ends with a build and the song's conclusion is instrumental, which is not satisfying for group singing.

So he and Alex Gorowara created a [simplified version](https://www.jefftk.com/p/simplified-level-up) with lyrics, chords and mp3.
