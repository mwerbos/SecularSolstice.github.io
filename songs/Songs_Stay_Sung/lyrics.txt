There is an end to everything,
The breath we take and the songs we sing,
And the last note rings and dies away,
But the song stays sung 'til the end of days.

    And all we do may be undone,
    But love stays loved and songs stay sung;
    Love stays loved and songs stay sung.

And astronomers have yet to chart
The constellations of the heart,
For lovers part and lovers pine,
But the love stays loved 'til the end of time.

    And all we do may be undone,
    But love stays loved and songs stay sung;
    Love stays loved and songs stay sung.

And every life's a brief, bright spark
That dies and seems to leave no mark,
So we curse the dark and we mourn the flame,
But the things it showed us still remain.

    And all we do may be undone,
    But love stays loved and songs stay sung;
    Love stays loved and songs stay sung.

And even worlds one day may die
And stars burn out in an empty sky;
Though time take all that life could give -
When the last light fades, our lives stay lived.

    And all we do may be undone,
    But love stays loved and songs stay sung;
    Love stays loved and songs stay sung.
