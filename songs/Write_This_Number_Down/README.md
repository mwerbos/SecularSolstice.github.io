# Write This Number Down
## By Dar Williams
## A measured celebration of justice and rule of law

In the Morning and Light arcs, we've got a bunch of songs about the present being better than the past, and the possibility of the future being better still. Mostly, they're about technology, and knowledge, and prosperity. This is a song about the world becoming more just and compassionate.

It's never clear what the number in the title is.  Perhaps the National Lawyer's Guild's "I was arrested for peaceful protest" hotline number? (1-212-679-6018)
