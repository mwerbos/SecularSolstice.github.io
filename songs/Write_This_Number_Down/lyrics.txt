Write this number down, you can call it anytime
We have been waiting for the day that you would finally drop the dime

I praise the ones who persevere in seeking justice through the law.
I caution there were those who felt abandoned and betrayed by what they saw.
Some stood in halls of silence,
With icy hints of violence
When they did seek justice through the law.

I'm witness to the commons and the institutions of the People's rule
The parents take their kids to local parks and then their kids head off to school
You might see the same old story
Greed and profit's allegory
I see kids who go to school.

A vote for one, a vote for all
A right to silence, one free call
You'll need a warrant for that
No she won't sit in the back,
And yes we're still abolishing all slavery
Every kind of slavery

So write this number down and know you won't slip through the cracks.
Look over your shoulder, there's millions of us there to get your backs.
You can play a crucial part,
Carry justice in your heart,
And we'll be there to get your backs.

Welcome to this land, and yes we still have all those marble steps to climb,
But write this number down, because it's growing all the time.
