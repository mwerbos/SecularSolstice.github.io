A moment outside space and time
Bounded boundless energy
Unsurrounded, undesigned
Tiny singularity
Not quite certain how or why
No one yet alive to see
Suddenly a burst of light
Endless possibility

Stardust, all of us are stardust
Stardust, all of us are stardust

Clouds amassing in the dark
Hundred billion miles wide
Eons pass until the spark
Dust collapsing, stars ignite
Atoms churning, torn apart
Searing hot and shining bright
Born anew within the heart
Bursting forth into the night

Stardust, all of us are stardust
Stardust, all of us are stardust

Silent lights across the black
Luminescent and sublime
Countless generations pass
No one there to see them shine
But then a cosmic happenstance
Circumstances just align
Somewhere on a fragile dot
Some tiny molecules combine

Stardust, all of us are stardust
Stardust, all of us are stardust

A simple drive to grow and thrive
Cradled on a tidal shore
Struggling to stay alive
Paving way for so much more
Not quite certain how or why
No one living yet could see
Suddenly a spark of life
Endless possibility

Stardust, all of us are stardust
Stardust, all of us are stardust
Stardust, all of us are stardust
Stardust, all of us are stardust

All of us are stardust
All of us are stardust
All of us are stardust
All of us are stardust
