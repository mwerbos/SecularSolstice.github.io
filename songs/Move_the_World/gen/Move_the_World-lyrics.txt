Archimedes said if I wanna move a load, gotta
get myself a lever, lay it on a fulcrum.
Little bit of effort, quite a bit o’ distance.
I can move a load, big as I wish....

(beat, beat, beat), I can

Move the World, if my lever is long enough
Move the World, and I’ve a place to stand
Move the World, make myself strong enough to
Move the World, if I got a good plan, yeah
.... If I got a good plan, yeah

But I must admit, world's pretty big
And all I got here, is a pitiful twig.
But if I had a friend with a great big beam,
I could say “Hey Friend!” if you share my dream

(beat, beat, beat), you can

Move the World, if your lever is long enough
Move the World, and you've place to stand,
Move the World, make yourself strong enough
Move the World, if you got a good plan, yeah
.... If you got a good plan, yeah

But it seems the beam is still not long enough.
Simple tools are cool but this is kinda tough But maybe
If we work together we can build a bigger lever,
We can make the world better if we give it a shove.

(beat, beat, beat) we can

Move the World, if our lever is long enough
Move the World, with a place to stand
Move the World, make ourselves strong enough to
Move the World, if you got a good plan, we can

Move the World, if our lever is long enough
Move the World, with a place to stand,
Move the World, make ourselves strong enough to
Move the World, if you got a good plan, we can
.... If you got a good plan, yeah
.... If you got a good plan, yeah
.... If you got a good plan, yeah
