Raise a song, and so commence
Circle, grow and grow.
in praise of all Benevolence!
Circle, grow and grow.
Once a cold and silent night
did the loveless stars pervade;
yet we here, of star-stuff made,
cast a circle of warmer Light!

Circle, circle, grow and grow.

So will we bring our families in,
Circle, grow and grow.
those whom Nature made our kin?
Circle, grow and grow.
Countless likenesses we find,
by our common blood bestowed.
What a debt of care is owed;
what a blesséd tie that binds!

Circle, circle, grow and grow.

And will we bring our neighbors in,
Circle, grow and grow.
our expansion to begin?
Circle, grow and grow.
Bounty of the harvest sun,
shelter from all hazards dire,
share with each, as each require,
doing as you would be done.

Circle, circle, grow and grow.

And will we bring the stranger in,
Circle, grow and grow.
every state and speech and skin?
Circle, grow and grow.
Think upon the mystery:
how alike is Humankind!
Tho' manifold in face and mind,
conspecific sisters we!

Circle, circle, grow and grow.

And will we bring the far ones in,
Circle, grow and grow.
all who distant-born have been?
Circle, grow and grow.
For the hands you'll never hold,
for the names you'll never learn,
for all far-off hearts that yearn,
let compassion boundless roll!

Circle, circle, grow and grow.

And will we bring all creatures in,
Circle, grow and grow.
feather, fur, or silicon?
Circle, grow and grow.
Though their unseen thought beguile —
strange the substrate they employ —
all who suffer or enjoy
are brother soul, in body wild.

Circle, circle, grow and grow.

And will we bring the future in?
Circle, grow and grow.
All of time is ours to win!
Circle, grow and grow.
Will our children rise in power?
overwhelm the starry deep?
Lights unborn, for you we keep
will and hope, though dark the hour.

Circle, circle, grow and grow.
