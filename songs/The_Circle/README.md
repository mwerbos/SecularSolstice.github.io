# The Circle
## By Taylor Smith
## Expanding the moral circle

If you're not familiar with the idea of Moral Circle Expansion, Michael Aird of Rethink Priorities has written [a good primer on it](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/M2gBGYWEQDnrPt6nb/moral-circles-degrees-dimensions-visuals).

This can be done as call-and-response, with a leader singing the first and subsequent odd-numbered lines.

Note that "far ones" here refers to people in distant lands, not Lovecraftian horrors, though some people hearing it may think the latter.

A version of this song [is on bandcamp](https://humanistculture.bandcamp.com/track/the-circle-scratch-recording)
