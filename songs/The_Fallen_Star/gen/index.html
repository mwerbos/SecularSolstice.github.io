<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
Late one night, a star fell from the heavens;<br>
Flickering, she landed in my hand.<br>
She said, “May I rest here for a second?<br>
I have come from such a distant land!”<br>
Then she laughed, her golden eyes a-twinkling<br>
Saying, “Though I may seem small to you,<br>
Do not think I’m weak, for you’ve no inkling<br>
Of the many wonders I can do.<br>
Tell me: what is it you most desire,<br>
What is it you yearn for through and through?<br>
I can grant you all that you require,<br>
I’m quite skilled at making dreams come true.”<br>
<br>
“Spirit, if that’s all you’re asking of me,<br>
All my wishes won’t take long to tell.<br>
I just want to love someone who loves me,<br>
I just want my mother to be well;<br>
Let our children laugh and trust and wonder,<br>
Love the things that swim and grow and fly;<br>
Let us all be sheltered from the thunder,<br>
And let only stars fall from the sky.<br>
Space to till our soil and grow our gardens,<br>
Shuttles flying daily to the moon,<br>
Grace to be unsparing with our pardons,<br>
And an end to war and illness soon.<br>
<br>
May our friendships never be a burden,<br>
May it never break you to be true;<br>
May old age bring wisdom, grace, and learning,<br>
Not a bitter load that wears you through.<br>
May the campfire smoke curl up above me<br>
As we sing this song and hear it swell -<br>
And I want to love someone who loves me,<br>
And I want my mother to be well.”<br>
So I went on, rambling and sighing,<br>
But I must have spoken far too long -<br>
The little star burnt out without replying;<br>
In the end she wasn’t very strong.<br>
</p>
