Late one night, a star fell from the heavens;
Flickering, she landed in my hand.
She said, “May I rest here for a second?
I have come from such a distant land!”
Then she laughed, her golden eyes a-twinkling
Saying, “Though I may seem small to you,
Do not think I’m weak, for you’ve no inkling
Of the many wonders I can do.
Tell me: what is it you most desire,
What is it you yearn for through and through?
I can grant you all that you require,
I’m quite skilled at making dreams come true.”

“Spirit, if that’s all you’re asking of me,
All my wishes won’t take long to tell.
I just want to love someone who loves me,
I just want my mother to be well;
Let our children laugh and trust and wonder,
Love the things that swim and grow and fly;
Let us all be sheltered from the thunder,
And let only stars fall from the sky.
Space to till our soil and grow our gardens,
Shuttles flying daily to the moon,
Grace to be unsparing with our pardons,
And an end to war and illness soon.

May our friendships never be a burden,
May it never break you to be true;
May old age bring wisdom, grace, and learning,
Not a bitter load that wears you through.
May the campfire smoke curl up above me
As we sing this song and hear it swell -
And I want to love someone who loves me,
And I want my mother to be well.”
So I went on, rambling and sighing,
But I must have spoken far too long -
The little star burnt out without replying;
In the end she wasn’t very strong.
