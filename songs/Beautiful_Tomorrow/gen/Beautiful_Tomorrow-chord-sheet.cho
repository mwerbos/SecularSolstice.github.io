{title: Beautiful Tomorrow -- Simplified A-minor version.}

Quarter note = 90 bpm
[Am]   I can hear tomorrowâ€™s voice call out and[Dm] lure me
In the [E]silver dew, it rings out like a[Am] bell
And the [F]path that stretches, [G]beckoning, be[C]fore me  [E]
Makes me [F]dizzy like a [B7]childrenâ€™s caro[E]usel

{comment: Chorus}
Oh [Am]beautiful to[Dm]morrow, donâ€[E]™t lead me into[Am]  sorrow
Be k[F]ind to me, tom[C]orrow, donâ€™t[G] lead me a[E]stray
Iâ€™ll[Am] chart a course to[Dm] follow, to[E] bring me to[Am] tomorrow
To b[Dm]eautiful to[Am]morrow, I st[E]art to make my w[Am]ay

I can hear tomorrow call me on a journey
To a world of wondrous beauty far away
I can hear it ask me urgently and sternly
For tomorrowâ€™s sake what have I done today?

{comment: Chorus}

Now Iâ€™ll strive to be both kinder and more honest
And to never leave a suffâ€™ring friend behind
I will toil each day to live up to my promise
I will blaze a trail if thereâ€™s no path to find
