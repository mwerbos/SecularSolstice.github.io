[Soprano,Alto]
Landsailor, landsailor sail on time, rain or shine I know you can.

Cloudraker, cloudraker share your finds, all your wonders at my demand.


[Bass]
Ah 

[Soprano,Alto]
Lightbringer, ta mer of night, blossom of hours un leashed.
Make me a 
lawbender,  (Bass: Ah )
all equalized, saved from the chill and heat.

[Soprano,Alto,Tenor,Bass]
Your power flows through me transformed, 

[Alto,Tenor,Bass]
Here's where I was born. 


[Alto,Tenor,Bass]
Landsailor, deep winter strawberry, endless summer, ever spring.
Our vast preserve, aisle after aisle in reach, every commoner made a king 

[Soprano,Alto,Tenor,Bass]
Earthbreaker, noble and prized, feed me beyond my means.
Hello worldmaker, never denied, build all my wildest dreams.
But there's a storm outside your door, I'm a child no more.



[Tenor]
Headless and faceless, tireless and seamless behind these walls, 
this is my progress when you don't notice my lines at all.


[Tenor,Bass]
Split the world open, 
delve ever deeper in my  (Soprano: Ooh )
alchemic arts,  (Alto: Ooh )
Crack the 

[Bass]
ciphers to free up your  (Soprano: Ooh ) (Tenor: ciphers your )

[Tenor,Bass]
mind, your life, your heart. 

[Soprano,Alto,Tenor,Bass]
Mm, mm 

[Tenor,Bass]
I'm your  (Soprano,Alto: Oh, )

[Soprano,Alto,Tenor,Bass]
landsailor in the bed that we've made, may every nail be shown.
Great life bringer, the price that we pay, time that you made it known.

[Soprano,Alto]
I want to be your bride in  (Tenor,Bass: Oh, be my bride in )

[Soprano,Alto,Tenor,Bass]
full, 

[Soprano,Alto]
shield my eyes no more. Oh, I am  (Tenor,Bass: shield your eyes no more. . )

[Soprano,Alto,Tenor,Bass]
altered now for good, shield these eyes no more.
