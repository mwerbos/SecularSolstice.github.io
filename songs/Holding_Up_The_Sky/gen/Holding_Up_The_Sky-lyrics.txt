  This game: it used to be fun
  To watch the clouds in the sky
  And see in each fluffy one
  The bunny or fortress passed by
  To name for each castle and whale
  The cobblers and kings living there
  To tell a whimsical tale
  Of people who dwell in the air
  But as those same tales take their wings
  The power of names stretches forth
  And soon all those cobblers and kings
  Have their own lives of meaning and worth

  So there's only...


      Holding up the sky
      Still holding up the sky
      To crawl so men may fly
      Each step to verify
      Though decades may pass by
      Always holding up the sky

  To yearn for rest and still ask why
  To heed what toil and pain have found:
  Who'd build a castle in the sky
  Must plant the feet on solid ground.
  To test and test each strand and curl,
  Anticipate how wind may blow,
  To know with fear the wide strange world,
  And little trust what lore you know.

  So you can be...

      Holding up the sky
      Still holding up the sky
      To crawl so men may fly
      Each step to verify
      Though decades may pass by
      Always holding up the sky

  To hold like kin those too who bear
  A fellow cloud or solar ray.
  To leave the future warnings clear
  Of all you wish you'd known today..
  To keenly spot and stoutly face
  The worms that lurk beneath the deep.
  To know and choose when to let fall
  A flake of snow you cannot keep.

  And you will be...

      Holding up the sky
      Still holding up the sky
      To crawl so men may fly
      Each step to verify
      Though decades may pass by
      Always holding up the sky

  There once was a dream of the youth
  And a game that children could play
  What remains is a glorious truth
  Is that such a high price to pay?
