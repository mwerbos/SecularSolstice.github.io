The sun'll come up tomorrow

Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow
There'll be sun

Just thinkin' about tomorrow
Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow
'Til there's none

When I'm stuck with a day that's short and snowy
I just stick up my chin and grin and say, oh

The sun'll come up tomorrow

So you gotta hang on 'til tomorrow
Come what may

Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love ya, tomorrow
You're only a day away

Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love ya tomorrow
You're only day away
