#  The Sun Will Come Up Tomorrow
## By Charles Strouse and Martin Charnin (mostly)
## A naive orphan's simple optimism, slightly tweaked

One could, of course, use the original Sun Will Come *Out* Tomorrow,
but betting one's bottom (last) dollar on the weather is way beyond
Kelly and the sort of SBFism we really don't want to encourage.
Whereas betting it on astronomy is more sensible.  And this fits
better with the themes of solstice.  If we are scared of the
persistently shortening day, it's not because we're scared of
*clouds*.

One might question the change of "grey" to "short" as it breaks a
rhyme.  To my ear at least, the broken rhyme and harsh plosive fits so
naturally with the semantic meaning that it's all good.

Sources differ about exactly what gets repeated at the end of the
song.  Just make sure all your performers and slides agree.
