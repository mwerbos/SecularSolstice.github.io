<p>One could, of course, use the original Sun Will Come <em>Out</em> Tomorrow, but betting one’s bottom (last) dollar on the weather is way beyond Kelly and the sort of SBFism we really don’t want to encourage. Whereas betting it on astronomy is more sensible. And this fits better with the themes of solstice. If we are scared of the persistently shortening day, it’s not because we’re scared of <em>clouds</em>.</p>
<p>One might question the change of “grey” to “short” as it breaks a rhyme. To my ear at least, the broken rhyme and harsh plosive fits so naturally with the semantic meaning that it’s all good.</p>
<p>Sources differ about exactly what gets repeated at the end of the song. Just make sure all your performers and slides agree.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
The sun'll come up tomorrow<br>
<br>
Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow<br>
There'll be sun<br>
<br>
Just thinkin' about tomorrow<br>
Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow<br>
'Til there's none<br>
<br>
When I'm stuck with a day that's short and snowy<br>
I just stick up my chin and grin and say, oh<br>
<br>
The sun'll come up tomorrow<br>
<br>
So you gotta hang on 'til tomorrow<br>
Come what may<br>
<br>
Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love ya, tomorrow<br>
You're only a day away<br>
<br>
Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love ya tomorrow<br>
You're only day away<br>
</p>
