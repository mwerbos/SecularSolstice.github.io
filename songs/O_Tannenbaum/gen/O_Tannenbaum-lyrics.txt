  O Tannenbaum, O Tannenbaum
  How faithfully you blossom
  O Tannenbaum, O Tannenbaum
  How faithfully you blossom
  Through summer’s heat and winter's chill
  Your leaves are green and blooming still
  O Tannenbaum, O Tannenbaum
  How faithfully you blossom


  O cedar tree, O cedar tree
  How noxious is your pollen
  O cedar tree, O cedar tree
  How noxious is your pollen
  Your powder blowing far and wide
  That leaves us red- and bleary- eyed
  O cedar tree, O cedar tree
  How noxious is your pollen


  O tree of worlds, O tree of worlds
  How timeless are your branches
  O tree of worlds, O tree of worlds
  How timeless are your branches
  Whose measure shines so clear and bright
  Our home in dark chaotic night
  O tree of worlds, O tree of worlds
  How timeless are your branches


  O Tannenbaum, O Tannenbaum
  How faithfully you blossom
  O Tannenbaum, O Tannenbaum
  How faithfully you blossom
  Through summer’s heat and winter's chill
  Your leaves are green and blooming still
  O Tannenbaum, O Tannenbaum
  How faithfully you blossom
