Let me teach you to wonder and worry.
Permit me to tell you how to wage war.
A creature’s reach should exceed its grasp,
Or what’s a Heaven for?

I’ll show you the way to take thought for tomorrow,
To struggle for dreams, and to hunger for more.
A creature’s sight should outrun its might,
Or what are the heavens for?

Taste of the fruit of the tree that is knowledge,
Of good and of evil, and all the world’s lore.
A creature’s thought must exceed what it’s taught,
Or who is Heaven for?

So come here and learn to become as the gods are,
For I’ve got a wonderful secret to tell:
A creature’s reach should exceed its grasp.
What else is Heaven or Hell?
