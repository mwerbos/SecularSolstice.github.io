<p>This song contains more biblical references than is perhaps ideal for a Secular Solstice song. Boston 2023's organizers were divided on whether it was ominous or idealistic, but it does embody a certain unwillingness to be complacent and content with what you have.</p>
<p>There's a lot of extra instrumentation that happens in the Leslie Fish version, but at its heart this can be a fairly simple guitar piece with a singer.</p>
<p>This song is available for sale via bandcamp in the <a href="https://lesliefish.bandcamp.com/track/lucifer">Avalon Is Risen</a> album.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
Let me teach you to wonder and worry.<br>
Permit me to tell you how to wage war.<br>
A creature’s reach should exceed its grasp,<br>
Or what’s a Heaven for?<br>
<br>
I’ll show you the way to take thought for tomorrow,<br>
To struggle for dreams, and to hunger for more.<br>
A creature’s sight should outrun its might,<br>
Or what are the heavens for?<br>
<br>
Taste of the fruit of the tree that is knowledge,<br>
Of good and of evil, and all the world’s lore.<br>
A creature’s thought must exceed what it’s taught,<br>
Or who is Heaven for?<br>
<br>
So come here and learn to become as the gods are,<br>
For I’ve got a wonderful secret to tell:<br>
A creature’s reach should exceed its grasp.<br>
What else is Heaven or Hell?<br>
