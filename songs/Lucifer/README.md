# Lucifer
## By Leslie Fish and Don Simpson
## Ambition and striving for more

This song contains more biblical references than is perhaps ideal for a Secular Solstice song. Boston 2023's organizers were divided on whether it was ominous or idealistic, but it does embody a certain unwillingness to be complacent and content with what you have.

There's a lot of extra instrumentation that happens in the Leslie Fish version, but at its heart this can be a fairly simple guitar piece with a singer.

This song is available for sale via bandcamp in the [Avalon Is Risen](https://lesliefish.bandcamp.com/track/lucifer) album.
