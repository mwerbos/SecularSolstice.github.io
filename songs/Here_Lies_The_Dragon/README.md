# Here Lies The Dragon
## By Corvus Corax, Translated by Jchan
## Celebrate the fall of the deadly dragon we've feared

This is by Corvus Corax the German band, not the species of raven or the Space Marine Primarch.  [Original version is here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7EpGRhvg6k)

[Translators notes](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bLFgxoubhDFnymwa8/solstice-song-here-lies-the-dragon#fnrefft9u8511lmo) are also available.

The original was just about a giant, fire-breathing, flying lizard, but recontextualized in solstice it might remind people of the Fable of the Dragon Tyrant.  Or not.
