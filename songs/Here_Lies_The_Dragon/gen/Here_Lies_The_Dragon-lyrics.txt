Come along and celebrate
Our suffering has ended
Come along and celebrate
The world the smith has mended
Here lies the dragon cold and dead
To trouble us no more
Here lies the dragon cold and dead
To rest forevermore

Come along and celebrate
Our suffering has ended
Come along and celebrate
The world the smith has mended
Here lies the dragon cold and dead
To trouble us no more
Here lies the dragon cold and dead
To rest forevermore

So many have met their death
Who fell to the fiery monster’s breath
But heartless worm there lies at last
And now our pain is past

So many have met their death
Who fell to the fiery monster’s breath
But heartless worm there lies at last
And now our pain is past 

Hear ye! Hear all high and low
Our joy has reawoken
Hear ye! Hear all high and low
The dragon’s curse is broken
Pour some wine and raise your glass
This calls for celebration
Pour some beer and raise your glass
Forever jubilation

Hear ye! Hear all high and low
Our joy has reawoken
Hear ye! Hear all high and low
The dragon’s curse is broken
Pour some wine and raise your glass
This calls for celebration
Pour some beer and raise your glass
Forever jubilation

So many have met their death
Who fell to the fiery monster’s breath
But heartless worm there lies at last
And now our pain is past

So many have met their death
Who fell to the fiery monster’s breath
But heartless worm there lies at last
And now our pain is past 

Give a hearty cheerful swell
And welcome endless pleasure
As it should be, all is well
So clap your hands together
There’s nothing now to make us sad
The sun is ever glowing
We sing aloud so bold and glad
With mirth aplenty flowing 

Day and night come dance with us
And savor life with singing
Every flask runs dry at once
What gift’s tomorrow bringing?
Old sorrow let us leave behind
No more be heavy-hearted
I bring for us the best of wines
The feast has hardly started

Come along and celebrate
Our suffering has ended
Come along and celebrate
The world the smith has mended
Here lies the dragon cold and dead
To trouble us no more
Here lies the dragon cold and dead
To rest forevermore
