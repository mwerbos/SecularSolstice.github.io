#  Song Of The Artesian Water
## By Banjo Paterson and Anna Tchetchekine
## A song about human ingenuity in the face of challenges.

A song about drilling down for artesian water , using machinery in a life-or-death situation. Similar in flavor to "Hymn to the Breaking Strain."

This was set to music by Anna Tchetchekine for the Bay Solstice in 2021. There is just [one recording](../Song_of_the_Artesian_Water_v2.m4a) (featuring Anna) and a chord chart, no sheet music as of yet.

It has also been set to music by Cathy O'Sullivan, a recording of which version [can be found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2rQSJqQnFE). The Cathy O'Sullivan version is unrelated to Anna Tchetchekine's arrangement and thus won't match the chord chart on this page.
