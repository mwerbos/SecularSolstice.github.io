## Traditional
## Celebration in the midst of winter

This song is old (first documented: 1625).  As such, it has many melodies and many recorded performances.  A good one is [Loreena McKennit's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWXuxjzpx6M).

There can be more verses than these three.  Wikipedia has five.  Some explicitly reference Christmas.
