# The Sun Is A Guy Who Travels Through The Sky
## By Raymond Arnold and They Might Be Giants
## An antiquated-style ode to the sun

To the tune of [The Sun Is A Mass Of Incandescent Gas](../../The_Sun_Is_A_Mass_Of_Incandescent_Gas/gen).

An MP3 [recording from Boston 2018](https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2018/02--why-did-the-sun-shine.mp3) is avaialable.

This songs has been facetiously introduced as:

> In honor of the ancient people who awaited the return of the sun, I want to start by singing an ancient hymn to the sun god, maybe one of the same hymns that they sung around their stone circles five thousand and twelve years ago. The tune is taken from a recovered pre-Druidic chant, but if by some chance you happen to know it anyway, sing along.
