#  Try Everything
## By Shakira
## Don't stop trying things.

Doing things is great. This song encourages people to, on the margin, do more things, even if some of the things they try fail. It's an anthem to persistance and a ward against discouragement. It's also a catchy pop song.

"Hermione felt a stab of disappointment. She really wished she wouldn't have felt that way, the boy wasn't a teacher, but it was still a test and she'd gotten a question wrong and that always felt like a little punch in the stomach.

(It said almost everything you needed to know about Hermione Granger that she had never let that stop her, or even let it interfere with her love of being tested.)" -HPMOR
