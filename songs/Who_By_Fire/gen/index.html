<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
# Intro<br>
.<br>
<br>
# Verse 1<br>
And who by fire<br>
Who by water<br>
Who in the sunshine<br>
Who in the night time<br>
Who by high ordeal<br>
Who by common trial<br>
Who in your merry merry month of May<br>
Who by very slow decay<br>
And who shall I say is calling?<br>
<br>
# Verse 2<br>
And who in her lonely slip<br>
Who by barbiturate<br>
Who in these realms of love<br>
Who by something blunt<br>
Who by avalanche<br>
Who by powder<br>
Who for his greed<br>
Who for his hunger<br>
And who shall I say is calling?<br>
<br>
# Verse 3<br>
And who by brave assent<br>
Who by accident<br>
Who in solitude<br>
Who in this mirror<br>
Who by his lady's command<br>
Who by his own hand<br>
Who in mortal chains<br>
Who in power<br>
And who shall I say is calling?<br>
</p>
