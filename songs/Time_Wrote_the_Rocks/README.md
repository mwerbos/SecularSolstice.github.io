#  Time Wrote the Rocks
## By Cat Faber
## Truth is found in the world

This song was originally "God Wrote the Rocks", contrasting with
"Humans wrote the bible".  It was changed because the goal of the
rationalist project is not to find flaws in religious fundamentalists
and laugh at them, but to find flaws in ourselves and fix them.
Thinking of irrationality as "that thing biblical literalists do" will
make it *harder* to recognize in ourselves.

The Galileo lines has been edited several times, in an effort to reconcile literal truth with artistic value. The most recent edit was in 2023, changing "when isolation broke his weary will" to "when threats and trials broke his weary will".

This song is available for sale via bandcamp in the [2015](https://humanistculture.bandcamp.com/album/solstice-2015) album, or a live NYC2019 recording in the files section.
