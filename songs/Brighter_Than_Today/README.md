#  Brighter Than Today

## By Raymond Arnold
## Our central anthem of hope, starting from the invention of fire

In many incarnations the solstice was *named* after this song.  Meddle
with it at your peril.

Nevertheless, there are a lot of old variants out there. The Boston Solstices have maintained [a fork](https://www.jefftk.com/p/brighter-than-today-versions) that is highly distinct from the Bay/NYC variants for some time. The DC variation is a slightly simplified version of the main Bay/NYC variant; an example recording can be found [here](../Brighter_than_Today_DC_2022.mp3) and chord sheet for it is available [here](./Brighter_Than_Today-chord-sheet.pdf).


This song is available for sale via bandcamp in [all three albums](https://humanistculture.bandcamp.com/).

There are several versions on youtube, most impressively the [three solstice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euwPYhriyCw) version, but also [NYC2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Gz9_mIcPs&index=4&list=PL2kAZU4YexD8EtbrNfI6RP0rjsTAIYwK6) and [Bayesian Choir Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=go9RFttl_-E) (link currently dead).

The 2020 version is [here](https://youtu.be/OHJmYyp6f4s?t=297) and 2020 version with everyone singing [here](https://www.jefftk.com/solstice-2020/08-five-hundred-million--brighter-than-today--2020-12-20-022605.mp3) (skip to time 4:57).
