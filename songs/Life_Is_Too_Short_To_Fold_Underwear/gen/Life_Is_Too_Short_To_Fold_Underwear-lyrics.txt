There’s one piece of wisdom that sticks in my head -
I heard it someplace, or it’s something I read
About someone or other whose grandmother said
That life is too short to fold underwear.

    Life is too short to fold underwear,
    Life is too short to play solitaire;
    Get off your duff, it’s time to begin -
    There’s good deeds to do and there’s sins to be sinned
    And there’s not enough time to fit it all in –
    Life is too short to fold underwear.

Life is too short to eat processed cheese
Or mealy tomatoes or third-rate Chinese,
Or to live someplace dismal without any trees,
And life is too short to fold underwear.

    Life is too short to fold underwear,
    Life is too short to play solitaire;
    Get off your duff, it’s time to begin -
    There’s good deeds to do and there’s sins to be sinned
    And there’s not enough time to fit it all in –
    Life is too short to fold underwear.

Life is too short to spend it alone
Or with folks that are mean, or a long way from home,
Or to serve an obsession that isn’t your own,
And life is too short to fold underwear.

    Life is too short to fold underwear,
    Life is too short to play solitaire;
    Get off your duff, it’s time to begin -
    There’s good deeds to do and there’s sins to be sinned
    And there’s not enough time to fit it all in –
    Life is too short to fold underwear.
    Yes, life is too short to fold underwear.
