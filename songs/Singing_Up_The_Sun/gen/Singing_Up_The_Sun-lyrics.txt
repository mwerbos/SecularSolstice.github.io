Back in the old days we used to sing up the Sun.
All through the longest night 'til the new day had begun.

Nowadays folks aren't sure what the point is,
But we can say we've never been disappointed,
The Sun always rises again every time that we call.
And when they say he'd do that anyway we can say
That's not the purpose at all:

When the night's darkest we say to the Sun:
You may think the darkness has already won.
You may even think you don't have enough light to shine through.
But we'll let our light shine if you let your let shine,
And if we can, then you can, too!

You know the Sun's not the reason we're making this fuss:
The light that we're summoning back is the light that's in us!

These are dark times, and hope's hard to hold on to,
We have to believe we can change if we want to,
We have to believe that the difference we make is for real!
This light of mine, I'm going to let it shine now
'Cause how else is the world going to heal?

When the night's darkest we say to our hearts:
With the sunrise tomorrow, let's make a new start,
Even if it seems so dark that we can't even see.
'Cause we're sure that the Sun will be rising  tomorrow,
And if he can, then so can we!
