<p>Original chords (in a somewhat confusing format) are <a href="https://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/01/bnewman/songs/lyrics/SingingUp-Sun.txt">here</a> and original recording is <a href="https://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/01/bnewman/songs/music/SingingUp-Sun.mp3">here</a>.</p>
<p>This song does a great job of linking modern and ancient solstice celebrations. It does have a few potential issues as regards epistemic virtue. The whole “we can say” thing feels a little motte-bailey-ish and the “have to believe” definitely isn’t how we do things. So maybe follow this with a Litany of Tarski over whether the change we make is for real or not.</p>

<h2>Lyrics</h2><p class=lyrics>
Back in the old days we used to sing up the Sun.<br>
All through the longest night 'til the new day had begun.<br>
<br>
Nowadays folks aren't sure what the point is,<br>
But we can say we've never been disappointed,<br>
The Sun always rises again every time that we call.<br>
And when they say he'd do that anyway we can say<br>
That's not the purpose at all:<br>
<br>
When the night's darkest we say to the Sun:<br>
You may think the darkness has already won.<br>
You may even think you don't have enough light to shine through.<br>
But we'll let our light shine if you let your let shine,<br>
And if we can, then you can, too!<br>
<br>
You know the Sun's not the reason we're making this fuss:<br>
The light that we're summoning back is the light that's in us!<br>
<br>
These are dark times, and hope's hard to hold on to,<br>
We have to believe we can change if we want to,<br>
We have to believe that the difference we make is for real!<br>
This light of mine, I'm going to let it shine now<br>
'Cause how else is the world going to heal?<br>
<br>
When the night's darkest we say to our hearts:<br>
With the sunrise tomorrow, let's make a new start,<br>
Even if it seems so dark that we can't even see.<br>
'Cause we're sure that the Sun will be rising  tomorrow,<br>
And if he can, then so can we!<br>
</p>
