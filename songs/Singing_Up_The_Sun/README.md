## The point of a solstice celebration

This song does a great job of linking modern and ancient solstice
celebrations.  It does have a few potential issues as regards
epistemic virtue.  The whole "we can say" thing feels a little
motte-bailey-ish and the "have to believe" definitely isn't how we do
things.  So maybe follow this with a Litany of Tarski over whether the
change we make is for real or not.
