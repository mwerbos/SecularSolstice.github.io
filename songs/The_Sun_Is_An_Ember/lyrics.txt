The sun is an ember we barely can remember,
An old and venerable story
We left it behind when we uploaded our mind
And we came into our glory.

The sun is gone, but we live on
Another billion years
It’s plenty bright, it’s plenty warm
Inside our Dyson spheres!

We’re not too sure
What winter is
The records aren’t clear
But still we sing this silly song
And party once a year!

The sun is an ember we barely can remember,
An old and venerable story
We left it behind when we uploaded our mind
And we came into our glory.
