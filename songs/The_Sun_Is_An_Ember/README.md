#  The Sun Is An Ember
## By Scott Alexander and They Might be Giants
## A futuristic ode to the sun

To the tune of [The Sun Is A Mass Of Incandescent Gas](../../The_Sun_Is_A_Mass_Of_Incandescent_Gas/gen).  Probably best used in conjunction with other variants of that original.

Explained at Bay 2022 as:

> 
Thank you all for going through that with me. Like I said, I’m really glad I have all of you.
>
> After the doom and gloom, I want to stress that it’s not just a question of doom vs. survival. It’s a question of doom vs. something much much better than we have now – immortality, interstellar civilization, post-scarcity. What kind of songs might we sing at the Solstice five thousand years from now?
>
> This bothered me enough that I got some of our friends at the Future of Humanity Institute to simulate the whole thing on a supercomputer. The good news is – they were able to determine with 99.9% probability the program of every Solstice from now until the end of time. The bad news is – we’re in their simulation right now.
>
> No, sorry! The good news is, they were able to provide me with a song that was sung at the rationalist solstice celebration in the year 5 billion AD. It’s written in some sort of melody made of sentient musical thoughtforms incomprehensible to mortals, but if somehow your puny brain can comprehend it, feel free to sing along.

And then, after it was sung,

> Sorry, I’ve just been informed that that was not a song made of sentient thought-forms from the year 5 billion AD, and may not be an accurate representation of what the future will be like.
