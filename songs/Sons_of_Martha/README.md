Christian inspiration [Luke
10:38-42](https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=niv:Luke%2010:38%E2%80%9342).

Astute fans of the poem will notice I've dropped two stanzas.  It's
still almost five minutes, so I really don't think we want longer.
More astute fans will note I've re-ordered two more, because the poem
has a subtle a-b-a-b-a-b pattern in its stanzas and the two I dropped
were three apart. The most astute fans will notice I moved the final
"and" from the end of
the penultimate line to the beginning of the ultimate one.  From a
poetic perspective, it hardly matters, but musically we want to draw
out tension before the punchline.

Those who are *not* fans of the poem may be a bit lost.  The original
Christian story is a bit obscure, and the Old Money vs People Who Work
dichotomy is somewhat more a thing of Kipling's time than ours.  And
the connection between them is either pure Kipling or otherwise lost
to time.
