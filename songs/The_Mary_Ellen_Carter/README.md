# The Mary Ellen Carter
## By Stan Rogers
## A folk song of determination and recovery

This has been introduced as "a Canadian folk song about trying to do the impossible". but to me (dspeyer) the theme that most resonates is "No matter what you've lost, ... like the Mary Ellen Carter, rise again!"  Both themes are present, and subjective experience is subjective.

Many versions of this song are on youtube.  My personal favorite is the [one from Longest Johns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKsVidS70xQ)
